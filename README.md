# PokeGuesser

A little game I made as a project on API connectivity for a web class. It interfaces with the API at [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co) to gather content. While in a perfect world you would want to put this on a web server and use caching to speed up data loading, I opted to construct it this way to demonstrate API access with AJAX as per class requirements.
